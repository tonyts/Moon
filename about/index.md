This is the second Silent Mountain I've ever built. The old one is on ycool, which is blocked by GFW for now. I love that place, no AD, not too much ppl, not too noice. Somehow I become a develop now, I should have my own place to record my projects, what I've done and what's going on in my mind.

The last post on the old site is posted on 2011-09-04 03:07. It means I've never been there for five years. How am I doing these days? I don't have a clue. Who can tell.
